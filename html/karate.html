                Kata is often described as a set sequence of karate moves organized into a pre-arranged fight against imaginary opponents.<br>
                The kata consists of kicks, punches, sweeps, strikes, blocks, and throws. Body movement in various kata includes stepping,<br>
                twisting, turning, dropping to the ground, and jumping. In Shotokan, kata is not a performance or a demonstration,<br>
                but is for individual karateka to practice full techniquesâ€”with every technique potentially a killing blow;<br>
                while paying particular attention to form and timing (rhythm).<br>
                Shotokan Karate is comprised of 26 katas, each with their own emphasis on fast and slow or controlled and powerfull movements.<br>
                Virtually all of the katas taught today in the Shotokan system have two kiai points.<br>
                The kiai or "spirit cry" as it is sometimes referred to, occurs only at certain pre-determined moments in each kata.<br>
                It is precisely at these pre-determined moments that the karate-ka is required to demonstrate a total commitment of body,<br>
                mind, and spirit, and to channel all of their available energy and apply it appropriately to the required technique.<br>
                The kiai is a common thread that runs through all major styles of karate.<br>
